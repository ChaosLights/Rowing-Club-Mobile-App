## Brief

-----------------
Why we chose those specific UML diagrams, etc...


## Team Management

-----------------
We managed the work by dividing into pairs...


## Reflection

-----------------
Add reflection here...

## Textual Analysis

In the process of textual analysis, actors and use cases were identified. We additionally noted a few requirements from the software that associated with the use cases of which the actors were linked to.
>Identifying the actors and use cases were essential for the rest of the requirements modelling stage, as it is what we will create diagrams based on.

## Personas

Knowing the specific needs of the apps users is essential to creating a good app, therefore we created a personas table to help us design specific features and functions for each user group.

Having all the personas can also help us later on when it comes to testing and validating the app against the requirements. By testing the app with users who fit each persona, we can ensure that the app is functional for each group. If it's not, we can make necessary adjustments.

Personas will also be essential to test and validate the app later in the software engineering process, as we will test the app with users that fit each persona to ensure the app is functional for each group.

## User Stories
As a **role** I want **goal** so that **outcome**
(Write a few for each role? Then possibly rank by importance to create a clear req checklist?)
