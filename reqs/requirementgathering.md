## Textual Analysis

In the process of textual analysis, actors and use cases were identified. We additionally noted a few requirements from the software that associated with the use cases of which the actors were linked to.
>Identifying the actors and use cases were essential for the rest of the requirements modelling stage, as it is what we will create diagrams based on.

## Personas

Knowing the specific needs of the apps users is essential to creating a good app, therefore we created a personas table to help us design specific features and functions for each user group.

Having all the personas can also help us later on when it comes to testing and validating the app against the requirements. By testing the app with users who fit each persona, we can ensure that the app is functional for each group. If it's not, we can make necessary adjustments.

Personas will also be essential to test and validate the app later in the software engineering process, as we will test the app with users that fit each persona to ensure the app is functional for each group.

As a **role** I want **goal** so that **outcome**
(Write a few for each role? Then possibly rank by importance to create a clear req checklist?)

COACH:

PARENT:

As a parent, I want to receive real-time notifications about my child's attendance at rowing club practices and events so that I can stay informed about their commitment and safety.

As a parent, I want to view a detailed progress report for my child's rowing performance, including metrics like speed, distance, and technique, so I can track their improvement over time and provide support as needed.

As a parent, I want to easily access a calendar within the app that displays the dates and details of upcoming rowing competitions and events, so I can plan my schedule accordingly and be there to support my child during their races.

As a parent, I want the app to provide a secure and private messaging feature that allows me to communicate with the rowing club coaches and other parents, ensuring I can get information and updates directly from the club's staff and engage with other parents.

As a parent, I want to be able to record and review videos of my child's rowing sessions through the app, so I can provide constructive feedback and support their development as a rower.

As a parent, I want the app to allow me to easily sign my child up for additional training sessions or workshops offered by the rowing club, so I can help them take advantage of extra opportunities to improve their skills and enjoy the sport even more.

JUNIOR ROWER ORGANISED BY PARENT:

As a younger rower, I want to use basic functionalities without parent's permission so that I can check for upcoming events and competitions in advance before asking my parents' permission to participate.

As a younger rower, I want to be able to sign up for events and competitions with my parents' permission so that I can participate in rowing events and improve my skills.

As a younger rower, I want to have a progress report generated after participating every signed-up events so that I can keep track of my personal data, make schedule for my next training and see my progress intuitively.

As a younger rower, I want to be able to filter events with age restrictions so that I can browse the avaliable events and make decisions more efficiently.

As a younger rower, I want to have the displayed events sorted according to my preference so that I don't need to see the events that are not included in my personal schedule and focus on the events that I am interested in.

PARENT:

JUNIOR ROWER ORGANISED BY PARENT:

Context:
John uses a rowing club software to keep track of upcoming events and register for competitions.
He has specific preferences in terms of event types, distances, and locations.

Scenario:

Logging In: John opens the rowing club software and logs into his account which is associated with his parents' account.

Accessing the Events Section: He navigates to the 'Events' section to see the upcoming rowing events or competitions.

Personal Preference Settings: John prefers to view events that are tailored to his level and interests. He taps on the 'Filter' button and selects options relevant to his preferences, such as 'Junior Level', '2000m Race', and 'Within 50 miles'.

Applying Filters: After applying the filters, the event list updates to show only those that match his specified criteria.

Sorting Options: John then uses the 'Sort' feature to sort the filtered events by date.

Registering for an Event: John browses through the events and selects an event happening next week, goes through the registration process, and sends a consent request to his parents for approval.

Confirmation: Once his parents approve, John receives a confirmation, and the event gets added to he and his parents' in-app calendar.

Outcome:
John successfully finds and registers for a rowing competition that fits his preferences and skill level, thanks to the personalized sorting and filtering features of the software.

Goal:
The scenario demonstrates how a junior rower under 17 can use the software to find and register for events that he's interested and valid, enhancing the user experience through personalized settings.
