## Brief

-----------------

[INTRO]

The diagrams we settled on producing are: personas, a use case diagram, user stories and scenarios. We also produced low fidelity screen prototypes for each user type.

*Personas*: As our application will include multiple user types, with each type having different function requirements, it is important for us to understand each of them, so that we can develop the app to includes functions fitting to each and every user. 
We did this through a persona board, so that we will be able to easily access information from each user type quickly during the development stages, 

*Use Case Diagram*: To ensure we are able to identify all the necessary functions for the application, we decided that a use case diagram will help us check what functions we actually need for our app. Furthermore, this will be useful when producing a product backlog.

*User Stories*: As we will be using user stories as specification points for our product backlog, it makes sense for us to work on it as part of our requirement gathering. This will allow us to easily check our app against a list of requirements, 
making it a lot easier to discover forgotten requirements or errors in the long run.

*Scenarios*: To be able to understand the systems in our application, we decided to use scenarios to grasp how the app features would work together, and how different users would use the application. 
This will help us in the development stages to integrate smaller functions together into the app.

*Low Fidelity Prototypes*: As we will be producing an application that requires a user interface, producing a prototype will allow us to map out where our elements will be, and how our screens may look like.
This will greatly reduce the time we spend on the user interface development as we will already have a plan on how to execute our idea.

## Team Management

We managed the work by dividing into pairs...


## Reflection

## Textual Analysis

In the process of textual analysis, actors and use cases were identified. We additionally noted a few requirements from the software that associated with the use cases of which the actors were linked to.
>Identifying the actors and use cases were essential for the rest of the requirements modelling stage, as it is what we will create diagrams based on.

## Personas

Knowing the specific needs of the apps users is essential to creating a good app, therefore we created a personas table to help us design specific features and functions for each user group.

Having all the personas can also help us later on when it comes to testing and validating the app against the requirements. By testing the app with users who fit each persona, we can ensure that the app is functional for each group. If it's not, we can make necessary adjustments.

Personas will also be essential to test and validate the app later in the software engineering process, as we will test the app with users that fit each persona to ensure the app is functional for each group.

He wants to pursue rowing as a career, and must train intensively to qualify for it.                                                                                                                  |

| Goals                     | Have a place where rowers will easily be able to see their progress and improvement, and input their rowing machine images without difficulty, to ensure there is more interaction from the rowers. And to ensure that Craig has all the information he needs available at the touch of a button.                                                                                   | He wants to be involved in his childâ€™s hobbies and act as a parental figure.

This includes attending available training sessions, and training to beat his current records.                                      |
| Environment and Knowledge | Craig has a background in rowing, learning it from the age of 13, and competing in competitions throughout university. As an adult he still rows recreationally and has an avid interest in helping others improve.

Grew up in a family supportive of sports. 2. Capable of using smartphones and computers for elementary tasks.                                                                            | Michael is familiar with how to a standard health app, as he currently uses one. He has a smartphone which he uses to access and make recordings of his training/time trials.                                                                                                   |

**Persona Priority**

Which persona has priority over other personas when creating the app? If so, why?

Coaches and both types of junior rowers are the primary users of our application, as they will be directly using it to enter information and record attendance. Therefore, their needs will be prioritised. On the other hand, parents are secondary users, as they will mostly use the application to receive information about competitions and training, but won't have many more interactions with the app.

Key Features discovered through analysis of personas:
- Log in system
- Events Calendar
- Training schedule (which rowers can show availability for)
- Image input for rowers
- ...
  (Further features are identified in the user stories.)

## Scenarios
(structured description of a process: define a setting/context, define one or more actors/stakeholders, define goals/objectives, define a plot)

**COACH:**

**PARENT:**

**JUNIOR ROWER ORGANISED BY PARENT:**

Register for an event under parental supervision

*Context*

John uses a rowing club software to keep track of upcoming events and register for competitions.
He has specific preferences in terms of event types, distances, and locations.

*Scenario*

Logging In: John opens the rowing club software and logs into his account which is associated with his parents' account.

Accessing the Events Section: He navigates to the 'Events' section to see the upcoming rowing events or competitions.

Personal Preference Settings: John prefers to view events that are tailored to his level and interests. He taps on the 'Filter' button and selects options relevant to his preferences, such as 'Junior Level', '2000m Race', and 'Within 50 miles'.

Applying Filters: After applying the filters, the event list updates to show only those that match his specified criteria.

Sorting Options: John then uses the 'Sort' feature to sort the filtered events by date.

Registering for an Event: John browses through the events and selects an event happening next week, goes through the registration process, and sends a consent request to his parents for approval.

Confirmation: Once his parents approve, John receives a confirmation, and the event gets added to he and his parents' in-app calendar.

*Outcome*

John successfully finds and registers for a rowing competition that fits his preferences and skill level, thanks to the personalized sorting and filtering features of the software.

*Goal*

The scenario demonstrates how a junior rower under 17 can use the software to find and register for events that he's interested and valid, enhancing the user experience through personalized settings.

**17-18 JUNIOR ROWER INDEPENDENT OF PARENT:**

<ins>Reviewing Previous Ergometer Records</ins>

*Overview*

As a new season is about to begin, Michael is keen on training to improve his erg records. He is currently pre-season training independently at a gym close to home. However, he needs a way to keep track of how well he is doing each training session, in order to work out a maximised training approach for himself.

*Rationale*

Since Michael is training individually, he does not have his coaches to tell him whether he is getting better. He also wants to be able to quickly view records from his phone, rather than having to contact the coach for those information every time. Michael also likes having a more visual representation of his records, as it motivate him more than looking at pure numbers.

*Details*

1. Michael opened the application from his phone, right before a training session.
2. He clicked on the records page, and is met with a graph showing the timing of his rowing from the last month.
3. He could see that during this last month, Michael's times was steadily decreasing, meaning his trainings are effective.
4. Michael saw the dip on the graph, showing where his best time is, and clicked on the 'record history' button under the graph to see the exact timings of his best time.
5. He scrolled through the records to find his best time, and used that as his current time goal to beat.

*Notes*

Although Michael is currently only reviewing his erg records at the moment, he should be able to review other records such as his time trial records from his phone as well. He should also be able to input new times on the application, so that his records are up-to-date.
