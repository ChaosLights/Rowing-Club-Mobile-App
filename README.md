# Introduction

Welcome to the Rowing Club Training App.

The aim of this project is to develop a custom mobile application for the Nottingham & Union Rowing Club. Faced with the outdated and confusing club website, club members are having a hard time entering information and attendance, and many no longer bother to participate in entering their information. The goals of our application is to promote easy attendance reporting, event participation confirmation, and progress tracking. Employing an iterative approach, we engaged in multiple cycles of prototype creation and discussion with our supervisor, to ensure requirements were thoroughly explored and understood. This is due to the complex data storage system we incorporated, while still maintaining user-friendliness. Initially working with Flutter, the project transitioned to React Native due to installation complications. Despite strict time constraints, we successfully laid the groundwork for our objectives. Looking ahead, a notable enhancement feature for our application lies in incorporating graphical visualization of training data directly within the application interface.
